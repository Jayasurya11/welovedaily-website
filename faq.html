              After you've successfully submitted your work we'll review your
              submission. If we see fit on the selected channel we'll get in
              touch. Keep in mind that a reply on your submission may take a day
              or two. If you don't receive a reply, we're sorry to disappoint,
              your submission was not selected to be featured.

              Selecting the best content for the Welovedaily channels takes
              time. With the revenue we gain from submissions we are able to
              cover expenses such as hosting and server costs.

              We handle payments via Stripe. When your work is selected we will
              get in touch via email. Attached to this email we will add the
              payment link. Reviewing of the submissions can take 1-2 days. At
              the moment we only handle payment via PayPal.

              Content regarding web, app and User Interface design we post on
              the account @welovewebdesign. This is currently our biggest
              account. Everything regarding the visual appearance of a brand,
              wether it's online or offline we'll post on @welovebranding. On
              @weloveillustration we post different styles of artwork and
              illustrations. Lastly we also manage @weloveanimations, it may be
              the smallest but it has the biggest viral possibility. With short
              snippets of delightful animations we are trying to brighten up our
              followers day.
